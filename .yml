  Our project is the card game Blackjack. The interface begins by allowing 
  users to choose a starting stack size and place their bets for the round. The 
  interfact then deals two cards to both the user and dealer, giving the user
  the options present in casiono-rule game of Blackjack. This includes the 
  abilities to hit, check, double, split, and/or surrender, and 3-2 payouts for 
  a blackjack. 
  
  I/O is supported along with a GUI that mimics the casino 
  experience using casino chips as money.
